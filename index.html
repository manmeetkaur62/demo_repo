/*
Here we have included a sample html page that we typed in vs code.
To do this we first opened this repo on our local machine by git clone "ssh-link".here ssh-link from your github is used for that repo.
Next we added this page and in order to track we used the command ' git add . '.This tracks all the file. and in addition we can track files that we want by individually typing
in their names. And then commit those using git commit -m "any informational message about our commit". Tracking and commiting gives us an advantage of commiting 
only those files and changes that we want.
Then we use git push to push our changes to remote repository where it is being hosted.
